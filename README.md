<!-- STAGE 1 -->
seed.py has been created with option to indicate number of users to seed the database. There is an option below the code that prints the database objects that are seeded just for confirmation and debugging

On windows, these are the commands:
1. To automatically seed the database with default first 150 users use (and get it printed on the console):
    python seed.py

2. To seed the database with any number of users you choose use (and get it printed on the console):
    python seed.py -t <number>
    python seed.py --total <number>
    
<!-- STAGE 2 -->
